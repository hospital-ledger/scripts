# Quickly Install and Setup Scripts (QISS)

<p align="right">For Version 4.1+</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The branch from Version-1.0 to Version-4.0 are abandoned, this master branch only support the install for Version-4.1 and higher Version. It is my first time to build a big project, I'm sincerely hope that you can help me to improve the level of coding and designing.

## Features

Version-3.0: It provides a method for users to install the network on CentOS 7 computer with X86_64 CPU which with 40G Disk free and more than 2G Memory free. The operating steps are on the Readme file in the branch.

Version-4.0: It provides a method for users to install the network on Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS Version and CentOS 7 computer with X86_64 CPU which with more than 40G Disk free and more than 2G Memory free. You can run them quickly by the installer in master since this version.

Version-4.1: Complete the error system in some process of installing.

Now, the scripts before Version-4.1 are not available in this repository anymore. You can find them in https://github.com/hospital-ledger/History-Collector/tree/master/scripts although I do not suggest you to use these scripts anymore for different errors.

Installer: It provides a method for users to install the network quickly, you can follow the steps under. Now you can install with the installer, you can change the Version in the "installer.sh", the latest Version is recommended, you also can edit it with the element in the support list. You can get the guide in "installer.sh".

## Installing Steps

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, you need to clone the scripts on your device. You need to install git or download the scripts as zip files on the GitHub.com, for installing the git and clone the scripts you can do like that under. 

```Shell
# For CentOS 7
yum install git

# For Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS
sudo apt install git

# After install the git, you can clone the repostory.
git clone https://github.com/hospital-ledger/scripts.git
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, you can open the directory for the scripts, run the "installer.sh" to start the installation process. Before that, you need to log in the system with root account.

```Shell
# Switch account to root
su
# And then you need to input your key of the root account.

cd /scripts
./installer.sh
# If there exists some problem to run the command, you may need to do that firstly.
chmod +x ./installer.sh
```

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, you need to check the software packages and the network, make sure they are working correctly.
