# Scripts
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These scripts can help us to set up the environment of the fabric quickly and easily. Although I have paste them into several files, there still some rules need to obey and follow. Firstly, you need to clone the scripts on the computer, maybe you can do like behind scripts, perhaps it is useful. Bless you. 
</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, by the way, these scripts are provided for CentOS, maybe you can run correctly them on Red Hat you prochased, but you cannot run them correctly on Ubuntu and other Linux Systems which based on Debian. Bless you again.

cd ./scripts
chmod +777 ./first.sh
./first.sh
# You need to check the software at the bottom of the script output mentions, 
# if they are not installed correctly, you need to run them again or check the error information, 
# and search them on the Internet by yourself.
./second.sh
# You need to check the software at the bottom of the script output mentions, 
# if they are not installed correctly, you need to run them again or check the error information, 
# and search them on the Internet by yourself.
./final.sh
# If the terminal output the BIG "Start" and HUGE "End", it means the environment is well, 
# otherwise you need to check the error of it and fix it by searching the Internet by yourself.
